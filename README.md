# Clean Architecture Web API Solution

Welcome to the Clean Architecture Web API Solution! This solution provides a structured and maintainable approach for building a powerful Web API. It follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which promotes a clear separation of concerns, enabling easier maintenance, testing, and future enhancements.

## Solution Structure

The solution is organized into distinct layers that encapsulate different aspects of the application:

- **Domain Layer:** Contains the core business logic, including entities, value objects, and domain services.

- **Application Layer:** Orchestrates application use cases, interacts with the domain, and defines application services.

- **Infrastructure Layer:** Handles data access, external services, and infrastructure concerns.

- **API Layer:** Exposes HTTP endpoints for interacting with the application.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Each layer has a specific responsibility, ensuring code remains organized and maintainable.

- **Dependency Inversion:** The solution uses dependency injection to decouple components and improve testability.

- **SOLID Principles:** Adheres to SOLID principles, enhancing extensibility and reusability.

- **Scalability:** The architecture supports the addition of new features and components without disrupting existing functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the code structure and explore how different layers interact.
3. Run the Web API project to observe its functionality.
4. Customize and extend the solution to fit your specific requirements.
